# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
**This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.**

Where we start by building and optimizing an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model. Once than we compare the accuracy of the best model to an Azure AutoML run. 

## Summary
The main object of this project is to predict if a client will subscribe to a terme deposit product (Variable value: ('yes') ,('no')) by using a dataset  (located  : https://www.kaggle.com/henriqueyamahata/bank-marketing ) related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution.

**The main step of the project are :**

1. Create a model using Azure Python SDK "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/azure-sdk-overview"  and a LogisticRegression "https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html" model

2. Tune the parameter of the Scikit-learn model using hyperdrive "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-tune-hyperparameters"

3. Create a Model using Azure Auto ML "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml" 

4. Compare the best performing model between the two created solutions based on their Accuracy 

**The best model is  :**

The best performing model **Using the VotingEnsemble Algorithm** with the Accuracy of **0.92014** was the result of the **Auto ML run.**

## Scikit-learn Pipeline :
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
